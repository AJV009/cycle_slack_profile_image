# Cycle Slack Profile Image

Just in case you are someone who recently got a pack of 200 weird profile images and want to share it with others on slack by changing your profile pic in a relavent period, clone this repo asap.

This is an unpolished script to simply loop, nothing else nothing complicated, feel free to edit and do whatever as you wish.

Yeah sure I know this could be all smaller with a 2-3 lines of bash, IK IK

I just happened to have another project using slack_bolt so just wanted to see how nicely it functions.

Don't blame me for any kind of bad app performance. its just for loops...

## Setup
1. clone project
2. run following commands
```bash
cd cycle_slack_profile_image
mkvirtualenv cycle_slack_profile_image
setvirtualenvproject
workon cycle_slack_profile_image
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. copy `sample.env` to `.env`, then edit and add variables as required.
